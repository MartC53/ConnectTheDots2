Analysis idea: throw multiple ensambles that include randomr forests at the problem. Consider fitting different
models based on the concentration of dots (prediction is easier when fewer dots).

Technology review plan:
Focus on ML (scikitlean, tensorflow, pytorch)

Focusing on improving viral load prediction using labeled data and existing features. Have produced model that
improves on prior approach.

Working to structure github to incorporate new models, tests, and update docs.
