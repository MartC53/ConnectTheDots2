User Stories

User 1: Cole Martin is a PhD candidate in chemical engineering at the University of Washington. He is working with a group 
that developed the underlying chemistry for the viral load tests, along with a phone application for quickly reading tests.
They need a model which more accurately produces viral load counts from samples, particularly at higher viral loads. They
also need to integrate the model into their existing phone application and update the model as new data, features, and 
prediction algoriths become availible.

User 2: James is a clinitian in a Federally funded health center. They are testing the app which inludes our model, 
with the goal of quickly collecting viral load data from patients. They need an inexpensive tool that can be used quickly.
They  have a very full schedule and do not have time to troubleshoot problems. They need a tool that is accurate adn fast
enough to coordinate patient care.

User 3: Chole is a researcher focused on developing new antiretroviral medications. They wants to use the phone app which
includes our model to collect data as part of a clinical trial. They need the tool to be inexpensive to operate and flexibly
collect metadata on samples. They also want to update our model to incorporate new features in their samples.
They have a PhD in Bio Chem and are somewhat technical.
