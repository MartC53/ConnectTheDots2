Name: Data Analysis Module

What it does: Our program processes and analyzes labeled viral load data. Steps includes importing data, running machine learning models for sample analysis, and updating the algorithm if required.

Inputs (with type information): 
- sampleData (type: array of objects) – Retrieved sample records for analysis.
- algorithmUpdate (type: file) – Updated code or model files for algorithm improvement.

Outputs (with type information):
- analysisReport (type: object) – A report with analyzed data, accuracy metrics, and performance metrics for the viral load analysis.

How it used other components: 
- Retrieves data from the Sample Database to analyze.
- Works with the Algorithm Management Module to ensure the latest algorithm is used.

Side effects:
- Generates a report and possibly updates the algorithm based on analysis.
- Logs details of each analysis session for future reference.
